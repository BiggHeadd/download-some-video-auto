# download-some-video-auto

this code is aiming to denote my knowledge of python net spyder, because i just learn how to use the requests, beautifulsoup and urllib to let my computer surf the internet and download the video like human-being. 
For the reason that so many great net like taobao, baidu, etc, these nets have great defence of prevent computer to get information, so my code on these nets may be stopped by them while running. So i chose a low net, though these things on the internet may not so benefit for me and you, but remember the first idea of me, i just want to practise python-spyder not for getting the videos.

if you use my code to downloading these videos and sharing with others, i will not take any responsibility, you have to be careful about it and try not to get in trouble.

good luck!
